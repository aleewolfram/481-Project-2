Intro:
	This program illustrates a simple farming simulation using four farm bots (farmzoids) that tend and harvest crops. We used LISP to create lists to help us with the 
	points that decide where the bots go. We then used Javascript to make multidimensional arrays for the farm and for making the paths of each farmzoid. Each farmzoid 
	moves to the plots they need to tend to in the minimum amount of moves they need to and avoid any obstacles in their way. The farmzoids will continue to tend to each
	of their plots until they can harvest their fruit and reach a total of 40 harvested fruit.

Setup and Installation:
	1. 	Download the .zip file
	2. 	Unzip the folder through 7Zip or other program.
	3. 	Open the Folder
	4. 	Double click the HTML file or drag it to the your browser.
	   	(In your browser, a tab should open)
	5. 	On that page a graph will be shown and above it will a be a "Start Farm" button.
	6. 	Click the "Start Farm" button and the animation will begin and ilustrate how to four farmzoids tend to their plots, return to the farm after they have reached
	   	their movement limits or finished their task, and continually do so day after day (where the day count is provided above the graph) until their fruit harvested 
		count reachs 40 (also shown above the graph).
